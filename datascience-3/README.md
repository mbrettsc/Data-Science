## Exercises Overview

### Introduction

This module focuses on understanding current data through exercises that include creating visualizations, analyzing correlations, standardizing and normalizing data, and splitting datasets to prepare for predictive modeling.

### Exercise 00: Histogram

- Create a graph to visualize the data using the "Test_knight.csv" file.

- Additionally, create a graph to understand the interaction between the knight’s skills (features) and the "knight" column (target) using the "Train_knight.csv" file.


### Exercise 01: Correlation

- Write a correlation factor to identify the columns with the strongest correlation between the target column "knight" and all feature columns.

### Exercise 02: It’s Raining Cats No Points!

- Display 4 graphs using both "Train_knight.csv" and "Test_knight.csv".

- One of the graphs must visually separate the clusters, while the other should mix them for each file.


### Exercise 03: Standardization

- Standardize and print your data.

- Display one of the graphs from the previous exercise using the standardized data.

- Ensure compatibility with both "Train_knight.csv" and "Test_knight.csv".


### Exercise 04: Normalization

- Normalize and print your data.

- Display the other graphs from Exercise 02 using the normalized data.

- Ensure compatibility with both "Train_knight.csv" and "Test_knight.csv".


### Exercise 05: Split

- Write a program to randomly split "Train_knight.csv" into "Training_knight.csv" and "Validation_knight.csv".

- You must explain the percentage retained in each file and the reasoning behind it.

## Conclusion

This module emphasizes the importance of data analysis in predicting future outcomes based on historical data, preparing you for real-world applications in data science.
